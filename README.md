## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (saved as CSS)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

I have learned that it is possible to build a faq accordion without JavaScript with the HTML-elements details and summary (sadly not supported in IE... ðŸ˜¶):

```html
<details>
  <summary>
    <h3>Question</h3>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <p>Answer</p>
  </div>
</details>
```

I rotated the arrow next to the questions using the transform-origin property which I never used before and found very helpful.

```css
::after {
  transform: rotate(180deg);
  transform-origin: center;
}
```

On Stack Overflow I learned that it is possible to make the opening of the accordion more fluid with an animation:

```css
@keyframes sweep {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    margin-top: -2rem;
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    margin-top: 0rem;
  }
```

I struggled to position the different images correctly, but this gave me the opportunity to practise this further.

### Continued development

In Firefox (and other browsers as well I asume) a scrollbar is shown when opening the accordion. This moves the whole container a few pixels to the left side which is not ideal. I fixed it with Chrome at least.

I had a weird issue with my image-box (my image) and content-box (the faq) and it still confuses me. I moved my content a bit upwards (margin-top: -X) and then it was obviously overlapped by my image-box because I could not click on my first question anymore. I thought a z-index would help me out but it actually did not. There must be something else going on or maybe I am just too blind and I do not see the real issue which causes this behavior.ðŸ¤¨ So I was sort of forced to set a hight on my image-box. That's probably not too bad but I thought I could solve it without setting a height.

## Acknowledgments

I looked at Riyana Gueco's solution on Frontend Mentor a few times because she solved this challenge without JavaScript as well. It helped me a lot when I got stuck and gave me some new ideas to try out.
